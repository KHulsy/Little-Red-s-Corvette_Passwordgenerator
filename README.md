Abstract: I wish truly that, like Miss Britney Jean, my password generator was multi-layered and pretty. Theoretically, a password generator should generate a password. In my swimming, I attempted to inflate entirely too many aesthetically pleasing pieces of pool decor. I started coding a website with a Bill O'Reillyian ghostwriter intensity before realizing that I needed to keep it simple. My password generator template came straight from Geeks for Geeks. Previously, it came from 1998,or its equivalent. Sean Napster was there. It was weird. There was a lot of terribly unnecessary code. I don't speak proficient variance yet. I'm in the first semester of Variance One, and my project is a video day. To be fair, I was able to code color. I also realized that I probably didn't need an embedded Youtube video for a password generator(especially for an educational institution). Also, Prince would come down from the purple clouds and stop mid-song until I deleted his copyrighted material. I remember that while alive he was not amenable to that, and it's important to respect fallen giants. Moving forward, I will remember to keep it simple. In closing, I am proud of this, though there is more to be done.
